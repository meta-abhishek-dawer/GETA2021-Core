Normalization :- Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characterestics like Insertion, Updation and deletion
Anamolies. It basically divides larger table into smaller table and links them using relationships. We use Normalization to remove repeatitive data and stores the data 
logically.

There are various kinds of Normal Forms which are listed below:- 
1. 1NF(First Normal Form)
2. 2NF(Second Normal Form)
3. 3NF(Third Normal Form)
4. BCNF(Boyce-Codd Normal Form)

1. 1NF(First Normal Form) :- This form simply says that each cell in a table should exactly contain one value. for example:- 
    Employee Name    Employee phone no.
     A               1234567890, 2345698230
     B               9762303467

  To make it in 1NF:-
     Employee Name     Employee Phone Number
       A                1234567890
       A                2345698230
       B                9762303467

2. 2NF(Second Normal Form):- for the second normal form, it should follow the two conditions which are listed below:-
      1. The table shoul be in first normal form
      2. The primary key of table should compose of exactly 1 column.
      for example:-
      Enrollment number  Student Name   Course code
         1                  A              CS101
         2                  B              CS102
         3                  C              CS101

      To convert in 2NF
       Enrollment Number  Student Name
         1                  A
         2                  B
         3                  C

       Enrollment Number  Course Code
         1                  CS101
         2                  CS102
         3                  CS101

3. 3NF(Third Normal Form):- for the Third Normal for, it should specify the following condition which are listed below:-
       1. The table should be in second normal form.
       2. There should not be any functional dependency.
       for example:-
       Course Code  Course Venue  Instructor's name  Department
         CS101       room 1         A                  CS
         CS102       room 2         B                  ECE

       if we want to change professor name, so also, we have to change department. so, to change in 3NF
       Course Code   Course Venue   Instructor's id
        CS101         room 1            1
        CS102         room 2            2
       
       Instructor's Id  Instructor Name  Department
         1                 A               CS
         2                 B               ECE

       So, if we want to change professor in a particular course. Then , we just change the id in that course.

4.  BCNF(Boyce Codd Normal Form):- for the BCNF, the table in 3NF. In A --> b, either A is super key or candidate key. for example:-
        Roll No.  Name  Voter Id
         1         A      101
         2         B      102
         3         C      103
         4         D      104

        Voter id  age
         101       20                    super key:- roll no, voter id
         102       30                    candidate key:-   roll number     Functional Dependency :-  roll no. --> name,  roll no. --> voter id,  voter id:- age, voter id--> roll no.
